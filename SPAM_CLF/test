You can have a look at OpenModelica. Its an open source equation oriented simulation environment. Its a general purpose simulator where you have to model your own unit operations. There is no built in library of unit operations in it. You can find OpenModelica tutorials on our spoken tutorials website. \r\n\r\n Apart from this there is an open source software named HINT for simulating heat exchanger network which involves concepts like pinch technology.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nRahul Jain                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 4

<br>Sir/Madam,<br><br>Where can I read about simulating basic logic gates using eSim. We tried out simulating using the d_inverter component from eSim_Digital library and the "pulse" source from the "eSim_Sources" library. But during simulation we get the error "Error while opening the python plotting Editor". I am sure we have made some mistake in the schema or may be while entering the values for the "pulse" component. Would you kindly look at the .cir file below and help us to solve the problem. We will also be very grateful if you kindly send us some tutorials on simulating digital circuits. <br><br>Best regards,<br>Arup Baruah.<br><br>The .cir file:<br><br>* /home/abaruah/Work/eSim/Workspace/Test06/Test06.cir<br><br>* EESchema Netlist Version 1.1 (Spice format) creation date: Mon Jan 18 12:57:10 2016<br><br>* To exclude a component from the Spice Netlist add [Spice_Netlist_Enabled] user FIELD set to: N<br>* To reorder the component spice node sequence add [Spice_Node_Sequence] user FIELD and define sequence: 2,1,0<br><br>* Sheet Name: /<br>U1&nbsp; Net-_U1-Pad1_ GND d_inverter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>v1&nbsp; Net-_U1-Pad1_ GND pulse&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>.end<br><br>The .cir.out file:<br><br>* /home/abaruah/work/esim/workspace/test06/test06.cir<br><br>* u1&nbsp; net-_u1-pad1_ gnd d_inverter<br>v1&nbsp; net-_u1-pad1_ gnd pulse(0 1 0 0 0 1 1)<br>a1 net-_u1-pad1_ gnd u1<br>* Schematic Name: d_inverter, NgSpice Name: d_inverter<br>.model u1 d_inverter(fall_delay=1.0e-9 input_load=1.0e-12 rise_delay=1.0e-9 ) <br>.tran 0e-00 0e-00 0e-00<br><br>* Control Statements <br>.control<br>run<br>print allv &gt; plot_data_v.txt<br>print alli &gt; plot_data_i.txt<br>.endc<br>.end<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    2

<br>Dear Navdeep,<br>The problem occurs only if the serial port isn't closed properly from scilab part and not from the arduino part.<br>And this issue occurs if you forcefully closes any program during the simulation.As far as my knowledge,there is no such issue from the firmware part.Anyway, i will go through it and let you know.But, it will be good if you also can find if any such bug exists in the firmware.<br><br>I didn't suggest you to perform toolbox related experiments and pure arduino experiments independently on different boards.First you perform all the related set of experiments either to toolbox or pure arduino sketches then other set of experiments.&nbsp; <br><br>Thanks,<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               2

Hii,<br><br>You have to use place global label which is present in right hand side toolbar of schematic editor window and then assign as input and output.

Hi, I am Kellim Worthington i am doing masters in public administration from the University of London i have done my graduation in business administration from one of the best university of United Kingdom. Well, i am here to ask you one thing, That i want to buy a laptop for my assignments because one day i was making my assignment and that time my laptop was on the charging and due to shortcircuit my laptop expired. Now I am so worried about my <a href="https://www.assignmentmaster.co.uk/" title="" target="_blank">Assignment Writing UK</a> so please let me know which laptop is the best in these days.  please suggest me because i want to purchase tomorrow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1

Please give me the solution/Tutorial to make the command run in windows, &nbsp;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1

Hi,<div>\r\n</div><div>We analyze results using different vectors, glyphs, contours on ParaView. I think you are an excellent coder, please go ahead and write a code to print values of volume fraction. As far as I know, there is no printing of values in almost any of the CFD software.  </div><div>\r\n</div><div>Regards</div><div>Viraj</div>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1

Hi Ankur,\r\nThere is createBaffleDict utility in OpenFoam to create Baffles in a geometry. \r\nI attach a youtube video link in which mesh is created using gmsh and the way to use the utility has been explained.\r\nThis will be easier than using snappyHexMesh which needs STL files.\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ex1RHDQqIc\r\nHope this will be useful.\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1
Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI am studying flow past a cylinder kept between two infinitely large plates. Reynolds no. is 500 and strouhal no. is 0.18.I want to get the co-efficient of drag and lift. How can i get the values?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nregards\r\nSubhankar                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1

I think you are not doing the installation properly. After downloading and unzipping  the source folder, please open the terminal, go to the folder eSim1.1.2, and run the installation script as:\r\n./install-linux.sh --install\r\n\r\nINSTALL is a text file explaining how to do the installation, not the installation script itself.\r\nPlease feel free to get back to us if you encounter any issues.\r\n\r\nAthul George\r\nFOSSEE, IIT Bombay\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1

<div>Hi following are the answers to your questions.</div><div><br></div><div>1. DWSIM is a steady simulation solver.</div><div>2. Yes, one can obtain stream wise material and energy balance report. Just click on the Results menu and click on build report, after that DWSIM will ask which all streams and stream properties you want in your report. The generated report will be in .pdf format.</div><div><br></div><div>Regards,</div><div>Rahul</div>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1
I am happy that you chose to post this "Scilab" question in the "Python" forum.  The reason is that Python is more suitable to computer programmers like you.  \r\n\r\nScilab is likely to have a lot more "application" type of libraries, compared to Python.  Scilab is more like Matlab than Python is.  But both of these advantages are not relevant to you.  On the other hand, it is possible to do all kinds of programming in Python: starting from device level communication to fancy application programming.  \r\n\r\nFinally, there are a lot of employment opportunities for those who know Python.  Because of all these,  please consider Python programming.  All the projects that I mentioned about Scilab are available for Python also.  For example, contribute a Python textbook companion.  If you are already good in Python, get into advanced activities like Django programming.  If you are good in Python programming, we will be interested in giving an internship or a full time job to you.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\nKannan\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1
Hi Subhankar,<div>\r\n</div><div>You can use "gnuplot residuals" to plot the residuals in OpenFOAM. The following link gives a clear idea of how to use it:</div><div>\r\n</div><div>http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam-solving/172931-plot-residuals.html</div><div>\r\n</div><div>\r\n</div>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1

Hello, I am trying to simulate flow over cylinder WITH a splitter plate attached in the front  in Openfoam..\r\nThe mesh seems to be fine ..but gives 1 failed check in checkMesh ..When i run pisoFoam solver it solves the equations \r\nbut i get unrealistic value of drag coefficient of over 500.Is\r\nthere any way I can send my case file so that anyone can check what is wrong\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1

Dear Sir/madam,<div>\r\n</div><div>   I was designing a pcb using KiCad in esim. When I have clicked generate netlist (.net) file, under the netlist window, there is no netlist option under pcbnew tool because of which when I click on footprint editor the left pane and right pane are empty no components and no footprints. How can I bring components into left pane and footprints into right pane? Netlist (.net) file is generated but still left pane and right pane are empty.</div><div>\r\n</div><div>Thanking You sincerely</div><div>Mob: 9916022964</div>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1

Hi Sai,\r\nI suggest you to go through solidDisplacementFoam and find whether it can be applicable for your case. Also check solidEqulibriumDisplacementFoam which is available in foam extend 3.1.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nSathish\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1
When the following source code is edited so that ngspice plot was opened after python plotting window, the above problem was solved. I got both python and ngspice plotting windows.<br>https://github.com/FOSSEE/eSim/blob/master/src/frontEnd/Application.py#L252<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1

When are you exactly getting this error, is it on clicking the eescheema button? Could you please elaborate on that?\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Good day Sir/Mam</span><div style="font-size: 15px;">\r\n</div><div style="font-size: 15px;">I am a chemical engineering student from South Africa. I watched the shortcut and rigorous distillation tutorial which were extremely helpful for my project. </div><div style="font-size: 15px;">\r\n</div><div style="font-size: 15px;">However I wanted to ask how do you assign operating pressure for distillation column ? I have to design a pressure swing distillation system, where the first column operates at a low pressure and the second column operates at a higher pressure to separate azeotropic mixture. How can I change the operating pressures of both columns?</div><div style="font-size: 15px;">\r\n</div><div style="font-size: 15px;">Your assistance would be much appreciated. \r\n</div><div style="font-size: 15px;">\r\n</div><div style="font-size: 15px;">Thank you in advance</div>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1
